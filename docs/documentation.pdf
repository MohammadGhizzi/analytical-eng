Airbyte and Metabase Setup Documentation
Overview
This guide will walk you through the steps to set up Airbyte and Metabase on separate EC2 instances running Ubuntu. The provided scripts will install necessary dependencies, set up Docker, and deploy Airbyte and Metabase.

Prerequisites
EC2 Instances: Two EC2 instances running Ubuntu (one for Airbyte and one for Metabase).
Security Groups: Ensure the security groups for these instances allow traffic on the necessary ports (e.g., 3000 for Metabase).
Setup Instructions
Part 1: Setting Up Airbyte
Step 1: Connect to the EC2 Instance
Connect to your Airbyte EC2 instance using SSH:

bash
Copy code
ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ubuntu@<Airbyte_Instance_Public_IP>
Step 2: Create and Run the Airbyte Setup Script
Create the airbyte.sh script:

bash
Copy code
nano airbyte.sh
Copy and paste the following content into airbyte.sh:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and upgrade all packages
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install Docker
sudo apt install -y docker.io

# Add user to Docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu

# Install Docker Compose v2
DOCKER_CONFIG=${DOCKER_CONFIG:-$HOME/.docker}
mkdir -p $DOCKER_CONFIG/cli-plugins
curl -SL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.18.1/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -o $DOCKER_CONFIG/cli-plugins/docker-compose
chmod +x $DOCKER_CONFIG/cli-plugins/docker-compose
docker compose version

# Download and run Airbyte
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/weclouddata/data/data/run-ab-platform.sh
chmod +x run-ab-platform.sh
./run-ab-platform.sh -b

# Print completion message
echo "Airbyte installation and setup complete."
Save and close the file.

Make the script executable:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x airbyte.sh
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
./airbyte.sh
Step 3: Access Airbyte
Once the setup is complete, you can access Airbyte on your browser by navigating to the public IP address of your Airbyte instance on port 8000:

arduino
Copy code
http://<Airbyte_Instance_Public_IP>:8000
Part 2: Setting Up Metabase
Step 1: Connect to the EC2 Instance
Connect to your Metabase EC2 instance using SSH:

bash
Copy code
ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ubuntu@<Metabase_Instance_Public_IP>
Step 2: Create and Run the Metabase Setup Script
Create the metabase_setup.sh script:

bash
Copy code
nano metabase_setup.sh
Copy and paste the following content into metabase_setup.sh:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and upgrade all packages
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install Docker
sudo apt install -y docker.io

# Add user to Docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu

# Pull the Metabase docker image
docker pull metabase/metabase:latest

# Run the Metabase docker container
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name metabase metabase/metabase

# Print completion message
echo "Metabase installation and setup complete."
echo "You can access Metabase at http://<Public_IP>:3000"
Save and close the file.

Make the script executable:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x metabase_setup.sh
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
./metabase_setup.sh
Step 3: Access Metabase
Once the setup is complete, you can access Metabase on your browser by navigating to the public IP address of your Metabase instance on port 3000:

Copy code
http://<Metabase_Instance_Public_IP>:3000
Post-Setup Configuration
Airbyte
Initial Setup: Follow the on-screen instructions to set up Airbyte.
Sources and Destinations: Add your data sources and destinations as needed.
Metabase
Initial Setup: Follow the on-screen instructions to set up Metabase.
Database Connections: Connect Metabase to your data sources.
Create Dashboards: Start creating dashboards and visualizations based on your data.
Troubleshooting
Permissions: Ensure that the ubuntu user is added to the Docker group.
Ports: Ensure that the security groups allow traffic on the necessary ports (8000 for Airbyte, 3000 for Metabase).
Logs: Check Docker logs for any errors if the services do not start as expected.
bash
Copy code
# For Airbyte
docker logs -f airbyte

# For Metabase
docker logs -f metabase
Conclusion
By following this guide, you should have Airbyte and Metabase set up and running on your respective EC2 instances. This setup will enable you to efficiently manage and visualize your data pipelines.
